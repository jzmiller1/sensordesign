Welcome to the Sensor Design project!
=============================
This project is a experimental sensor design training application.  The sensor designer program will introduce students to remote sensing concepts such as:

1. Resolution (Spectral, Spatial, Radiometric and Temporal)
2. Reflectance and "Spectral Signatures"
3. Atmospheric Windows
4. Spectral Mixing (Mixels)

and much, much more!


To-Do Items
==============

1. Create unittests
2. Implement atmosphere model
3. Implement spatial resolution component
4. Implement radiometric resolution component
5. Create exe build process.
